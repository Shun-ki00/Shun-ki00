## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm Shunki Shimizu, a 3rd year student in the Game Science Department at Trident Computer Vocational School. During my studies, I have participated in over 10 game jams both within and outside the school, developing my ability to collaborate with teams and deliver results under tight deadlines. Winning the Excellence Award at a school competition was a meaningful recognition of my implementation skills and project proposal abilities.
During my 2-month study abroad program in Singapore, I worked on game development projects with local students, where I learned to actively communicate and collaborate in a multicultural environment. This experience enhanced my adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills in international development teams.

## 🎨 Hobbies
In my personal time, I'm passionate about men's makeup and fashion, constantly researching the latest trends while developing my own unique style. I excel at providing styling and makeup advice, with friends often praising my sense of aesthetics and saying they feel more confident after my suggestions. I believe that enhancing one's appearance can boost inner confidence, and I focus on creating personalized recommendations that highlight each individual's unique qualities.
